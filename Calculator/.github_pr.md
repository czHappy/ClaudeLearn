# GitHub Pull Request - Add Logarithm Operations

## Title
Add logarithm operations to Calculator class

## Base branch
`main`

## Compare branch
`feature/add-logarithm-operations`

## Description

### Summary
This PR adds logarithm calculation support to the Calculator class, extending its functionality beyond basic arithmetic operations.

Closes #1

### Changes Made

#### 1. New Features
Added three logarithm methods to the Calculator class:
- **`ln(double x)`**: Natural logarithm (base e)
- **`log10(double x)`**: Common logarithm (base 10)
- **`log(double x, double base)`**: Logarithm with custom base

#### 2. Implementation Details
- **File**: [include/Calculator.h](include/Calculator.h)
  - Added method declarations for `ln()`, `log10()`, and `log()`

- **File**: [src/Calculator.cpp](src/Calculator.cpp)
  - Implemented all three logarithm methods
  - Added `#include <cmath>` for standard math functions
  - Comprehensive input validation with descriptive error messages

#### 3. Error Handling
All logarithm functions validate inputs and throw `std::invalid_argument` exceptions for:
- `x ≤ 0` - Logarithm of non-positive numbers is undefined
- `base ≤ 0` or `base = 1` - Invalid logarithm bases (for `log()` method)

#### 4. Testing
- **File**: [tests/test_calculator.cpp](tests/test_calculator.cpp)
  - Added `testLogarithm()` function with 13 comprehensive test cases
  - Tests cover:
    - Natural logarithm calculations (ln(e), ln(1), ln(e²))
    - Common logarithm calculations (log10(10), log10(100), log10(1))
    - Custom base logarithm (log₂(8), log₂(16), log₃(27))
    - Exception handling for invalid inputs (negative numbers, zero, invalid bases)
  - ✅ All tests pass successfully

#### 5. Documentation
- **File**: [README.md](README.md)
  - Updated Features section with logarithm operations
  - Added detailed usage examples with logarithm functions
  - Added API documentation for all three logarithm methods
  - Updated test output examples

### Test Results
```
Running Calculator Unit Tests...

================================
All tests passed successfully!
```

### Usage Example
```cpp
#include "Calculator.h"

int main() {
    Calculator calc;

    // Natural logarithm
    double ln_e = calc.ln(2.718);       // ≈ 1.0 (ln(e))

    // Common logarithm
    double log_100 = calc.log10(100.0); // 2.0 (log₁₀(100))

    // Custom base logarithm
    double log2_8 = calc.log(8.0, 2.0); // 3.0 (log₂(8))

    return 0;
}
```

### Breaking Changes
None. This is a backward-compatible feature addition.

### Checklist
- [x] Code follows existing style and conventions
- [x] All new code is covered by unit tests
- [x] All tests pass locally
- [x] Documentation has been updated
- [x] No breaking changes introduced
- [x] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

### Review Notes
- The implementation uses the change-of-base formula for custom base logarithms: `logₐ(x) = ln(x) / ln(a)`
- Input validation ensures mathematical correctness and provides clear error messages
- Test coverage includes both normal operations and edge cases
