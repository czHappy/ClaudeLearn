# GitHub Issue - Add Logarithm Operations Support

## Title
Add logarithm operations to Calculator class

## Labels
- enhancement
- feature-request

## Description

### Problem Statement
The Calculator class currently only supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Many scientific and engineering calculations require logarithm operations, which are not currently available.

### Proposed Solution
Add support for logarithm operations to the Calculator class:

1. **Natural Logarithm (ln)** - Calculate logarithm with base e
2. **Common Logarithm (log10)** - Calculate logarithm with base 10
3. **Custom Base Logarithm (log)** - Calculate logarithm with any valid base

### Benefits
- Extends calculator functionality for scientific computing
- Maintains consistent API design with existing methods
- Includes comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs
- Fully tested with unit tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `ln(x)` method for natural logarithm
- [ ] Implement `log10(x)` method for common logarithm
- [ ] Implement `log(x, base)` method for custom base logarithm
- [ ] Add proper error handling (throw exceptions for invalid inputs)
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests (at least 10 test cases)
- [ ] Update README documentation with usage examples
- [ ] All tests must pass

### Technical Details
- Throw `std::invalid_argument` exception when x ≤ 0
- Throw `std::invalid_argument` exception when base ≤ 0 or base = 1
- Use C++ standard library `<cmath>` functions
- Follow existing code style and patterns
